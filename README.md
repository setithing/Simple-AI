<h1>Simple-AI (Overlord)</h1>

Simple-AI is designed to learn just like a person. If it dosn't know what to say it will ask.

The idea is that it will build up a (very) large data base of replys.

More code will be added to improve selection of replys

When complete it will be called something other than Simple-AI

<h2>Files:</h2>
>Ai.py - Main program it loads a JSON file in data which contains replys<br />
>data - Contains the JSON DB<br />
>>brain.json - where all the data is stored
<br />
